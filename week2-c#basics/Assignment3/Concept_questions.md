### 2. What is the difference between the static, const, and readonly keywords when applied to a type member?
### 3. What does a constructor do?
### 4. Why is the partial keyword useful?
### 5. What is a tuple?
### 6. What does the C# record keyword do?
### 7. What does overloading and overriding mean?
### 8. What is the difference between a field and a property?
### 9. How do you make a method parameter optional?
### 10. What is an interface and how is it different from abstract class?
### 11. What accessibility level are members of an interface?
### 12. True/False. Polymorphism allows derived classes to provide different implementations of the same method.
### 13. True/False. The override keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing its own implementation of a method.
### 14. True/False. The new keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing its own implementation of a method.
### 14. True/False. The new keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is
### 15. True/False. Abstract methods can be used in a normal (non-abstract) class. 
### 16. True/False. Normal (non-abstract) methods can be used in an abstract class. 

### 17. True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were virtual in the base class. 
### 18. True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were abstract in the base class. 
### 19. True/False. In a derived class, you can override a method that was neither virtual non abstract in the base class.
### 20. True/False. A class that implements an interface does not have to provide an implementation for all of the members of the interface.
### 21. True/False. A class that implements an interface is allowed to have other members that arenâ€™t defined in the interface.
### 22. True/False. A class can have more than one base class.
### 23. True/False. A class can implement more than one interface
