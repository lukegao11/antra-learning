### 1. What are the six combinations of access modifier keywords and what do they do? 
public: The public access modifier is the most permissive and allows access from any other class in any package. Public class members can be accessed without any restrictions.

protected: The protected access modifier allows access from within the same package and subclasses in any package. Protected class members can be accessed by classes in the same package or by subclasses of the class in any package.

default (package-private): The default access modifier (also called package-private) allows access from within the same package only. Class members with default access can be accessed by classes in the same package but not by classes in other packages.

private: The private access modifier is the most restrictive and allows access only from within the same class. Private class members cannot be accessed by any other class.
public protected: This combination is not valid because both modifiers are mutually exclusive.
private protected: This combination is also not valid because both modifiers are mutually exclusive.
### 2. What is the difference between the static, const, and readonly keywords when applied to a type member?
### 3. What does a constructor do?
### 4. Why is the partial keyword useful?
### 5. What is a tuple?
### 6. What does the C# record keyword do?
### 7. What does overloading and overriding mean?
### 8. What is the difference between a field and a property?
### 9. How do you make a method parameter optional?
### 10. What is an interface and how is it different from abstract class?
### 11. What accessibility level are members of an interface?
### 12. True/False. Polymorphism allows derived classes to provide different implementations of the same method.
### 13. True/False. The override keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing its own implementation of a method.
### 14. True/False. The new keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing its own implementation of a method.
### 14. True/False. The new keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is
### 15. True/False. Abstract methods can be used in a normal (non-abstract) class. 
### 16. True/False. Normal (non-abstract) methods can be used in an abstract class. 

### 17. True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were virtual in the base class. 
### 18. True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were abstract in the base class. 
### 19. True/False. In a derived class, you can override a method that was neither virtual non abstract in the base class.
### 20. True/False. A class that implements an interface does not have to provide an implementation for all of the members of the interface.
### 21. True/False. A class that implements an interface is allowed to have other members that arenâ€™t defined in the interface.
### 22. True/False. A class can have more than one base class.
### 23. True/False. A class can implement more than one interface
